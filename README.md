### VSCode

Vscode does not seem to like multi-language setups, you will want to either open your language of choice (for example `code ./2024/rust`) as the root of your project, or add it as a workspace folder ([Add Folder to Workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_adding-folders)).
