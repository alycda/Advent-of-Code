# Advent of Code Solutions Repository

> Learning in Public! with PlutoTV / Paramount

## Getting Started

1. Create your personal branch using the format:

> solutions/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/YEAR

This branch is your personal learning space - feel free to push your solutions but note that we keep solutions separate from the main branch, which is reserved for language setups and infrastructure (no need to open a pull request for YOUR branch).

2. Choose your preferred programming language from our [supported templates](#batteries-included), or set up your own workspace.

```

           └── README
```

3. Visit [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) to begin your coding challenge journey!

## Batteries Included:

We provide ready-to-use templates in various programming languages. Find them in the year/language folders (e.g., `2024/rust`).

### VSCode

Vscode does not seem to like multi-language setups, you will want to either open your language of choice (for example `code ./2024/rust`) as the root of your project, or add it as a workspace folder ([Add Folder to Workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_adding-folders)).
